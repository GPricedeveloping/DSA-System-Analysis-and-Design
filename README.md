# DSA-System-Analysis-and-Design

I recently completed a project focused on developing a command-line application tailored to support academic advisors within ABCU's Computer Science department. The application serves as a tool to streamline course management processes and enhance the advising experience for both advisors and students. As part of this endeavor, I created a robust system that enables advisors to input course data from files, generate sorted lists of available courses, and retrieve comprehensive information about specific courses, including prerequisites.

Using the application is straightforward â€“ simply obtain the code from the repository, compile it using a C++ compiler, and execute the resulting executable file. The interface is designed to be intuitive, with a user-friendly menu guiding users through various functionalities seamlessly. Looking ahead, I envision potential enhancements such as incorporating a graphical user interface for improved usability and integrating additional features to assist students in planning their courses effectively. Collaboration and feedback are encouraged as I continue to refine and expand upon this project. If you're interested in contributing or have suggestions for improvement, I'd love to hear from you. Let's work together to make this tool even more valuable for academic advisors and students alike.
